# My Tech Radar

> It's on my radar

Ever used this phrase? Me too. This is my attempt at keeping track, in visual
form, of everything that is "on my radar". It is a living record of the
technologies I know about.

This radar is inspired heavily by similar radars used by
[OVO Energy](https://techradar.ovotech.org.uk/),
[Zalando](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/), and other companies to
document technologies used within the company and enable engineers to pick the
best new technologies for new projects.

Zalando helpfully open-sourced
[the code used to generate their radar](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar).
This radar is running on a heavily refactored version of their original design,
which affords a greater understanding of how the chart works and enables easier
modifications, such as adjusting the number of rings.
