# My Tech Radar

> It's on my radar

Ever used this phrase? Me too. This is my attempt at keeping track, in visual
form, of everything that is "on my radar."

The code here is heavily inspired and borrowed from [Zalando's Tech
Radar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/), which in turn is inspired by the
work done by [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).
