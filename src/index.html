      <h3>What is this?</h3>

      <p>
        Have you ever used the phrase "<em>it's on my radar</em>"? Well this is
        my radar. It is a living record of the technologies I know about, split
        into three rings with the following semantics:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b class="key">Expert</b> &mdash; Technologies I am most comfortable
          with, and would use to tackle new problems with high confidence.
          These are typically technologies I use on a regular, frequent basis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="key">Strong</b> &mdash; Technologies I have used with
          success in multiple projects. These are typically either technologies
          that I am actively gaining experience in, or technologies that I have
          used extensively in the past.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b class="key">Competent</b> &mdash; Technologies I have invested
          time into learning, often completing smaller experiments and test
          projects, but have not fully explored in depth. These could be
          technologies that I want to learn more about, or have come into
          contact with whilst working on large systems.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why?</h3>

      <p>
        I primarily use this as a tool to not only keep track of what I know
        about, but also to help me discover gaps or weaknesses in my knowledge
        that I can work to improve.
      </p>

      <p>
        This radar is also a helpful aid that allows me to quickly impart upon
        other developers or people within the industry the knowledge and skills
        that I possess. It can concisely answer common questions of "<em>Do you
        know about X?</em>".
      </p>

      <h3>How?</h3>

      <p>
        This radar is inspired heavily by similar radars used by
        <a href="https://techradar.ovotech.org.uk/">OVO Energy</a>,
        <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/">Zalando</a>, and
        other companies to document technologies used within the company and
        enable engineers to pick the best new technologies for new projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zalando helpfully open-sourced
        <a href="https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar">the code used to
        generate their radar</a>. This radar is running on a heavily refactored
        version of their original design, which affords a greater understanding
        of how the chart works and enables easier modifications, such as
        adjusting the number of rings.
